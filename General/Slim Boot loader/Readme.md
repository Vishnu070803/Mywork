Start with the Arrow lake Boot Flow pdf document to know the process, dont bother about the meaning every technical detail just study for the flow.
Now study the Complete Intel x86 boot flow pdf to get the technical details, names and other details in the boot flow(99% accurate, but there may have updates or a small factual correction, check other documents and online resources for better knowledge)
Cover other 2 files if you are interested, those just have extra boot flows of arm vs x86 and other details.
