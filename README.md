Projects and the data I have worked on so far in my journey, and the future.
The Linux folder holds the Linux projects, drivers and application codes along with the docs I have referred.
The C_practice folder is for the programmes that I have been practising, mostly bit and Linked list operations.
The Firmware Folder currently holds one project about the LED blink with external interrupts, with complete low-level programming on Arduino Uno R3.
