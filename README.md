# Projects Overview

This repository contains the projects and data I have worked on so far in my journey, along with references for future exploration.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **Linux_Projects/**
Contains Linux-related work, including:
- Device drivers
- Application code
- Reference documentation used during development

### 2. **C_practice/**
Contains C programs I have practised, mainly focused on:
- Bit manipulation
- Linked list operations

### 3. **Firmware_Projects/**
Currently includes:
- **LED Blink with External Interrupts** â€” developed with complete low-level programming on the **Arduino Uno R3**.

> **Note:** A `drawings/` folder exists but mainly contains project diagrams and other `.drawio` files. These have also been placed in their respective project folders for better organization.

This repository will continue to expand as I work on new projects and explore additional domains.
