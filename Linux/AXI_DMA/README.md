# AXI-DMA Configuration

The AXI-DMA can be configured in the following modes:
- **Micro-DMA**
- **Scatter-Gather**
- **Circular Mode**

In this project, I have configured the AXI-DMA in **Micro-DMA** and **Scatter-Gather** modes.

For both scenarios:
- Driver and application code are included.
- Working PetaLinux images are provided for the **ZedBoard**.

I have made every effort to write clean, readable, and well-structured code for ease of understanding and maintenance.
